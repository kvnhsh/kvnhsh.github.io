GitHub Wikis is a simple way to let others contribute content. Any GitHub user can create and edit pages to use for documentation, examples, support, or anything you wish.
Restrict editing to collaborators only 
Public wikis will still be readable by everyone.
Issues 
GitHub Issues adds lightweight issue tracking tightly integrated with your repository. Add issues to milestones, label issues, and close & reference issues from commit messages.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
